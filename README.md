# Huntcraft SMP

Information about a certain semi-private, server-side modded Minecraft server.  (Server-side mdos are like plugins).

## Modpack Info

There is an optional client-side modpack for the SMP, which gives features such as a world map, proximity chat and an FPS boost.  You can also use this client on other servers, at least in the default configuration.  It contains no unfair advantages as I see it.

Both the [Server]() and [Client]() modpacks are available for download.  You are free to distribute these modpacks, as per the MIT License, but I do ask that you give credit and link back to the respective Modrinth page.  Thank you!

## Joining the Server

If you want to play on Huntcraft itself, please join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MyxagkAe) and request to be whitelisted.
